            <p>Trees enhance the beauty and value of a property, but there are times when they become a risk. Knowing when to call a <b><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/dGEu92YtbgFx2zv98">Tree Service in Atlanta GA</a></b> for tree removal is essential for safety and property protection. Trees affected by disease, structural instability, or storm damage may need professional attention to prevent hazards.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Signs of a Dying or Diseased Tree</h2>
            <p>One key reason for tree removal is disease. If you notice discolored leaves, peeling bark, or lifeless branches, the tree may be in distress. Fungal growth at the trunk's base is another warning sign of decay. A diseased tree can weaken and fall unexpectedly, posing risks to surrounding structures and people.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Structural Instability and Leaning Trees</h2>
            <p>A tree leaning significantly may have root damage or internal decay. Sudden tilting, visible cracks in the trunk, or exposed roots suggest that the tree is unstable. If you notice these signs, a tree service in Atlanta GA</b> can assess whether it should be removed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Storm-Damaged Trees and Safety Risks</h2>
            <p>Severe weather can weaken a tree’s structure. High winds, lightning, and storms often leave trees with broken limbs or large cracks. Inspect trees after a storm and contact a professional if you notice severe damage to avoid falling branches and property damage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Overgrown Trees Interfering with Structures</h2>
            <p>Tree branches growing too close to your home, power lines, or sidewalks can cause problems. If roots push up pavement or branches scrape against your roof, it may be time to call a tree removal expert. Overgrown trees can also block sunlight, affecting grass and other plant growth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Trees Blocking Views and Aesthetic Appeal</h2>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Tree Root Damage and Foundation Issues</h2>
            <p>Tree roots can cause structural problems when they grow too close to a home’s foundation. Cracks in sidewalks, driveways, or shifting foundations may be linked to root damage. In such cases, removing the tree may be necessary to avoid costly repairs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Trees Harboring Pests and Infestations</h2>
            <p>Pest-infested trees can weaken and spread insects like termites or carpenter ants to nearby structures. Removing an infested tree promptly can help prevent further damage to your property and surrounding greenery.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Dead or Fallen Trees Posing a Hazard</h2>
            <p>Dead trees can become unstable over time, attracting pests and increasing fire risks. Even if a fallen tree seems harmless, it should be removed to maintain the safety and aesthetics of your landscape.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Tree Removal for Landscaping and New Construction</h2>
            <p>Sometimes, trees must be removed for home additions, new driveways, or landscaping renovations. A professional tree service in Atlanta GA</b> can help determine which trees to preserve and which to remove for construction plans.</p>
        </div>
